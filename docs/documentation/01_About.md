# METEOR Overview

METEOR is a summary statistics-based multi-outcome mendelian randomization method that utilizes a set of correlated instrumental SNPs and self-adaptively determines the sample overlap as well as multiple pleiotropic effects, both of which are commonly encountered in MR analysis. We consider a general model in which multiple outcomes may originate from different datasets, and we allow sample overlap between exposure and outcome. METEOR first accurately estimate the correlation matrix parameter using data from genome-wide summary statistics, then places the inference of the causal effects into a likelihood framework, accompanied by a scalable sampling-based algorithm to obtain calibrated p-values. With extensive simulations and real applications, we have illustrated METEOR can control type I error, boost power, obtain accurate estimates.
